## Continuous Integration and Deployment ##

1. Using the Git command line interface

       git add .

   Please notice the point(.) at the end of the expression;

       git commit -m "Your commit message"

       git push

   If successful, your code should be committed and pushed to the remote repository.


2. Using Eclipse with Git

  In Eclipse:
  1. Go to Git Staging view.

  2. You should now see the file you've changed in the Unstaged Changes area.

  3. Drag & Drop the file from the previous point onto Staged Changes area.

  4. Write a nice commit message and click Commit and Push.

After pushing the code to the remote repository in Developer Cloud Service, why don't have a look on the result:
