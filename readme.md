Let's go on a Code Adventure and explore new ideas, technologies and skills. In this edition of Code Adventures we will explore container native development through three 20 minutes talks on Microservices, Kubernetes and Serverless followed by a selection of coding adventures where you can get hands-on with the technologies discussed.

After the Initial talks there will be three different code adventures you can go on

1. Microservices - The DevStar
2. Serverless - Launch A Rocket into Space
3. Kubernetes - Space Race

# [Microservices - The DevStar](microservices/README.md)

In this Adventure you will complete missions to become the Dev Star.

Choose your platform space fighter of choice (Node.js, Java or PHP) and develop and deploy cloud native microservices that will help defeat the Alien War Ship.

* You will learn how to build, manage and deploy cloud native microservices.
* You will learn how to manage the source control, continuous integration and continuous deployment of your microservices in a DevOps manner.
* You will explore and perform actions related to scaling and operating your microservices.
* You will use your creativity and team play to develop features to your microservices that will help you win.

# [Serverless - Launch A Rocket into Space](serverless/readME.md)

In this Adventure, you will attempt to launch a rocket into space. You will create some Serverless functions that set the parameters for the launch and deal with various challenges you will encounter. Once deployed you will register your functions with Mission control and they will use your functions to launch a rocket.

There will be prizes for the best launch.

* You will learn how to create a serverless function in fnProject using go, node.js, python or java.
* You will learn how to deploy a serverless function using an existing container as your function code.
* You will learn how to create a hot function and explore the lifecycle of a function in fnProject.
* You will use your creativity to develop features that help your function make the best rocket Launch.

# [Kubernetes - Space Race](kubernetes/README.md)

In this Adventure, you will walk in the footsteps of the USSR in their quest to dominate space. 

You will use Kubectl and Wercker to deploy and manage an application that represents Sputnik (the first satellite in space) we wil deploy Sputnik to space (well Kubernetes at least).

* You will learn how to manage and deploy containers on Kubernetes.
* You will learn how to manage continuous integration and continuous deployment of your container in a DevOps manner.
* You will explore and perform actions related to scaling and operating your cluster.
